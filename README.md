# The Evercraft Kata   

In this exercise, you will build out a simple web-based RPG called Evercraft for the company Blizzards of the Coast.  Leverage acceptance test driven development, in addition to all the other practices we've learned, to build this game.

This will be a simple web app that just uses HTML and submit buttons. 

## Setup
To drive the browser with Selenium install:

```brew tap homebrew/cask && brew cask install chromedriver```

## Running Cucumber

Run cucumber tests using `gradle cucumber` from the command line or in the Gradle menu of IntelliJ.

## Requirements


#### Character display

> As a player, I want to view my character's data so that I see how I stack up against my opponent

- can display each character's name, hit points, armor, etc.

#### Character Can Attack

> As a combatant, I want to be able to attack other combatants and damage my enemies so that they will die and I will live

- roll a 20 sided die. Call the d20 service which returns a random number from 1 to 20.
- has an Armor rating that defaults to 10
- roll must meet or beat opponents armor class to hit
- if attack is successful, other character takes 1 point of damage when hit
- if a roll is a natural 20 then a critical hit is dealt and the damage is doubled
- has 5 Hit Points by default
- when hit points are 0 or fewer, the character is dead

### Armor Types
> As a combatant, I want to wear different types of armor to influence my rating.

| Material | Base Rating | Modifier | Net Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bronze | 10 | -1 | 9 |
| Iron | 10 | 0 | 10 |
| Steel | 10 | +1 | 11 |

- Armor also has a weight. Heavy armor (greater than 50 pounds) grants an additional +2 modifier to the armor rating. 

#### Character Has Abilities Scores

> As a character, I want to have several abilities so that I am not identical to other characters except in name

- Abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution
- Abilities range from 1 to 20 and default to 10
- Abilities have modifiers according to the following table

|   Score   | Modifier |   Score   | Modifier |   Score   | Modifier |   Score   | Modifier |
|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|
|   __1__   |    -5    |   __6__   |    -2    |  __11__   |     0    |  __16__   |    +3    |
|   __2__   |    -4    |   __7__   |    -2    |  __12__   |    +1    |  __17__   |    +3    |
|   __3__   |    -4    |   __8__   |    -1    |  __13__   |    +1    |  __18__   |    +4    |
|   __4__   |    -3    |   __9__   |    -1    |  __14__   |    +2    |  __19__   |    +4    |
|   __5__   |    -3    |  __10__   |     0    |  __15__   |    +2    |  __20__   |    +5    |

#### Character Ability Modifiers Modify Attributes

> As a character, I want to apply my ability modifiers improve my capabilities in combat so that I can vanquish my enemy with extreme prejudice

- add Strength modifier to:
    - attack roll and damage dealt
    -  minimum damage is always 1 (even on a critical hit)
- add Dexterity modifier to armor rating
- add Constitution modifier to hit points (hit points cannot start below 1)

#### Character data loading

> As a player, I want to specify the character data of my two combatants

Character data will be stored in a CSV file with the format:

`Character,Armor,Strength,Dexterity,Constitution`

The first line of the file should use the text above as a header record. An example data record is:

`Steve,10,10,10,10`
